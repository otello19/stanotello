    <h2>Kovacic is Chelsea Player of the Year
    <hr>
    <h4>Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Giroud were better...</h4>

    <p>Although Kovacic impressed me last season, I was 
    pretty surprised he was voted player of the year. My reason
    was mostly because he was not as consistent and effective as
    some other players. I had a shortlist of five players for the award.
    Unfortunately, the fifth player it. They are in this particular order: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mason Mount,</li>
        <li>Ceasar Azpilaceuta,</li>
        <li>Tammy Abraham,</li>
        <li>Olivier Giroud, and</li>
        <li>Mateo Kovacic.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
    It's all said then, no undermining of his effort and contribution 
    last season, which was Ballack-sque at times. Let's go Blues!
